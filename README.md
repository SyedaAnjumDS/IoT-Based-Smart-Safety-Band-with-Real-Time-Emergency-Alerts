**⚙️ Working of the Device**
The Smart Safety Band continuously remains in standby mode.
In an emergency situation, the user presses the panic button.
The device immediately fetches the current GPS location.
The GPS data is processed by the microcontroller.
Using the GSM module, an SMS alert containing the user’s real-time location is sent to predefined emergency contacts.
The alert enables quick action and timely assistance.
This entire process happens without smartphone dependency, ensuring uninterrupted performance during emergencies.
